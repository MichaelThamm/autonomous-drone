## Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
* The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was chosen due to its light weight and relatively high computation ability.
* A Raspberry Pi for this project is required due to the integration of computer vision and autonomous drone control.

## Considerations
* Since it is operating on a drone it must be a [battery-powered-pi](https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-power-your-raspberry-pi-with-a-lithium-battery/).
* This requires an [adafruit-converter](https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-PowerBoost-1000-Charger-Rechargeable/dp/B01BMRBTH2?keywords=power+boost+module+from+Adafruit&qid=1638742547&sr=8-10&linkCode=ll1&tag=circbasi-20&linkId=b4ff7f31c018cab02c9818fa05e0bc84&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)
