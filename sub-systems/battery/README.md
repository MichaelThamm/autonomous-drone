# External needs
* Need a DC/DC converter to convert the battery voltage to 5V.
## Raspberry Pi
* The Raspberry Pi needs to be powered with 5V DC up to 1.28A
## Oak-D Lite
* To use a [battery-powered Oak-D Lite](https://discuss.luxonis.com/d/1767-powering-oak-d-lite), Luxonis recommends the [Y-adapter](https://docs.luxonis.com/projects/hardware/en/latest/pages/DM6010/#y-adapter)
* The power port wants 5V DC power up to 2.1A
* USB-C to the power port and the [data-to-Pi-see-section-6](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware/blob/master/DM9095_OAK-D-LITE_DepthAI_USB3C/Datasheet/OAK-D-Lite_Datasheet.pdf)
* If you don't have USB-C, use battery rated for at least 1A / 5W (preferably 2A / 10W)
* Always connect the 'power' first before connected the host to the 'data'
