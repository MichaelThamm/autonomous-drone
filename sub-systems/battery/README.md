# Raspberry Pi
* The Raspberry Pi needs to be powered with 5V DC, so we need to have a DC/DC converter to convert the battery voltage to 5V.
* If you’re powering the Raspberry Pi with a rechargeable battery, you need to have a battery charge controller.
* Charge controllers regulate the incoming current and voltage to your batteries.
* They are used to prevent overcharging, allow you to charge your lithium batteries safely, prolonging your battery’s lifespan.
