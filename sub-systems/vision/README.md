# Y-Adapter
* I can connect a [0.5'-usbc](https://www.amazon.com/CableCreation-Braided-Compatible-MacBook-Resistance/dp/B01CZVEUIE?th=1) to the py at the data splitter.
# Wireless Video Transmission
* The goal is to send the video data to a laptop from the Oak-D Lite on the drone
* OPTION: I can send the data usbc to the pi and I can view the video via [VNC over SSH wirelessly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QBFDO5xoZI).
