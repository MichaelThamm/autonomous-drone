# FC and ESC Stack
* A [flight-controller](https://oscarliang.com/flight-controller-explained/#Flight-Controller-What-it-is-and-How-it-Works) is a circuit board equipped with sensors that detect the droneâ€™s movements and user commands. With this information, the FC signals the [ESC](https://oscarliang.com/esc/) to move the drone in the desired direction.
* After reading [best-fc-esc-stack](https://oscarliang.com/top-5-best-fc-mini-quad/), the chosen FC and ESC stack was:
* [Speedybee F405 V3 FC + 50A BLHeli_S 4in1 ESC](https://www.amazon.com/SpeedyBee-Flight-Controller-Stack-Configuration/dp/B0BFQ3X892/ref=sr_1_4?camp=1789&creative=9325&keywords=speedybee+f405+v3&linkCode=ur2&linkId=bc576ce7bb8496867e3d21903b7925c5&qid=1693113981&sr=8-4)
* The Racerstar brushless motors recommend a 45A ESC and the Speedybee F405 V3 FC + 50A BLHeli_S 4in1 ESC is 50A continuous per motor.
* IMPORTANT: In order to prevent the stack from being burnt out by voltage spikes on powering up, it is strongly recommended to use the Low ESR capacitor in the package.

# Standard Control
* I need to buy the stack peripherals: controller, radio chip, ...

# Autonomous Control
## Raspberry Pi 4 B
* Since it is operating on a drone it must be a [battery-powered-pi](https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-power-your-raspberry-pi-with-a-lithium-battery/).
* Use a usb-c cable splitter for data and power. Then connect battery to splitter for power and data for outgoing to transmitter.

## Python Program
