# Explanation
* Receiver: This is your radio receiver, which communicates with your RC transmitter. It receives control signals from your transmitter and sends them to the FC to control the drone's flight.
* PPM Receiver: PPM (Pulse Position Modulation) is a communication protocol used by some RC receivers. It's an alternative to traditional PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for transmitting multiple channel signals over a single wire. If you have a PPM receiver, it connects to the PPM input on the FC.
* DJI Air Unit: This refers to the DJI Digital FPV Air Unit, which is a high-quality digital video transmission system for FPV (First-Person View) drones. It connects to the FC for video transmission and control.
* Analog VTX (Video Transmitter): This is an analog video transmitter for transmitting the video feed from your FPV camera. It connects to the FC for video signal management and control.
* Buzzer: A buzzer is used for various purposes, such as low battery warnings, arming/disarming notifications, and locating your drone if it crashes or gets lost. It's typically connected to the FC for control.
* Servo: If your drone design requires a servo for functions like camera tilt, landing gear retraction, or other mechanical movements, it connects to the FC.
* Phoenix 2 RunCam: This refers to the RunCam Phoenix 2, which is an FPV camera. It connects to the FC to transmit the video feed to your FPV goggles or video transmitter.
* Note: The Phoenix 2 RunCam is not needed and will be replaced with the Oak-D lite
