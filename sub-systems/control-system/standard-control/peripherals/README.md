# Explanation
* Receiver: This is your radio receiver, which communicates with your RC transmitter.
* PPM Receiver: PPM (Pulse Position Modulation) is a communication protocol used by some RC receivers. It's an alternative to traditional PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) for transmitting multiple channel signals over a single wire. If you have a PPM receiver, it connects to the PPM input on the FC.
* DJI Air Unit: Digital video transmission system for FPV (First-Person View) drones.
* Analog VTX (Video Transmitter): This is an analog video transmitter for transmitting the video feed from your FPV camera.
* Buzzer: low battery warnings, arming/disarming notifications.

# Transmitter & Receiver
* The FC supports an SBUS Receiver. SBUS allows you to transmit multiple channels of control data over a single wire.
* Configure the FC to receive SBUS signals and map the channels correctly for throttle, pitch, roll, yaw, and any auxiliary functions.
* Make sure to choose an ELRS 2.4GHz SBUS receiver compatible with your transmitter and follow the binding and configuration instructions provided with the receiver to establish a secure connection between your transmitter and receiver.
