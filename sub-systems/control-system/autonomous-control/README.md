# DepthAI to ArduCopter
* start with enabling SSH and VNC
* [manual-DepthAI-installation](https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/tutorials/first_steps/#first-steps-with-depthai)
* [ardupilot-depthai-scripts](https://github.com/rishabsingh3003/ardupilot_depthai_scripts?tab=readme-ov-file#depthai-scripts-for-ardupilot)
  * `main.py` runs on the RPi and uses the DepthAI library
  * `main_app.cpp` runs on an ESP32 device. It sends Mavlink messages to control a drone based on the tracked object's position.

- [understanding-altitude-ekf](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-understanding-altitude.html)

The EKF is responsible for generating attitude, velocity, position, and altitude estimates for the vehicle. EKF takes the IMU, GPS, and BARO sensor inputs with the vertical distance sensor.

# Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
* The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is required due to the integration of computer vision and autonomous drone control.
* I can view the video via RDP over SSH wirelessly while the drone is flying.

* The following sections are modules which can be installed on the Pi for drone functionality:
  * [MAVLink](#mavlink)
  * [Oak-D Lite](#oak-d-lite)

## MAVLink
* MAVLink is the communication protocol used by many GCS software.
* [MAVLink-docs](https://mavlink.io/en/)
* [MAVSDK](https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/main/en/index.html)
* Ardupilot uses mavlink to communicate and there are things like "mavproxy" which does all the routing to external devices, and "pymavlink" for programmatically talking to the flight controller.
