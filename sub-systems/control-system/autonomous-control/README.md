## Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
* The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was chosen due to its light weight and relatively high computation ability.
* A Raspberry Pi for this project is required due to the integration of computer vision and autonomous drone control.

## Considerations
* Since it is operating on a drone it must be a [battery-powered-pi](https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-power-your-raspberry-pi-with-a-lithium-battery/).
* I can view the video via [VNC over SSH wirelessly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QBFDO5xoZI) while the drown is flying.
